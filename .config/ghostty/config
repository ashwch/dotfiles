# This is the configuration file for Ghostty.
#
# This template file has been automatically created at the following
# path since Ghostty couldn't find any existing config files on your system:
#
#   /Users/monty/Library/Application Support/com.mitchellh.ghostty/config
#
# The template does not set any default options, since Ghostty ships
# with sensible defaults for all options. Users should only need to set
# options that they want to change from the default.
#
# Run `ghostty +show-config --default --docs` to view a list of
# all available config options and their default values.
#
# Additionally, each config option is also explained in detail
# on Ghostty's website, at https://ghostty.org/docs/config.

# Config syntax crash course
# ==========================
# # The config file consists of simple key-value pairs,
# # separated by equals signs.
# font-family = Iosevka
# window-padding-x = 2
#
# # Spacing around the equals sign does not matter.
# # All of these are identical:
# key=value
# key= value
# key =value
# key = value
#
# # Any line beginning with a # is a comment. It's not possible to put
# # a comment after a config option, since it would be interpreted as a
# # part of the value. For example, this will have a value of "#123abc":
# background = #123abc
#
# # Empty values are used to reset config keys to default.
# key =
#
# # Some config options have unique syntaxes for their value,
# # which is explained in the docs for that config option.
# # Just for example:
# resize-overlay-duration = 4s 200ms
# Toggle the Quick Terminal from anywhere (system-wide)
keybind = global:cmd+shift+1=toggle_quick_terminal

# Tweak the overlay behavior (macOS-only)
# Position options: top, bottom, left, right, center
quick-terminal-position = top
# Screen options: main, mouse, macos-menu-bar  
quick-terminal-screen = mouse
# Keep open when it loses focus
quick-terminal-autohide = false
# Space behavior options: move, remain
quick-terminal-space-behavior = move
quick-terminal-animation-duration = 0.15

keybind = shift+enter=text:\n

# ==============================================================================
# tmux Integration - Ghostty-style shortcuts for tmux panes
# ==============================================================================
# These send escape sequences that tmux interprets as pane commands
# Only active inside tmux - Ghostty's native splits still work outside tmux

# Pane splitting (matches Ghostty native shortcuts)
keybind = cmd+d=text:\x1b[1;2P
keybind = cmd+shift+d=text:\x1b[1;2Q

# Pane navigation with Cmd+Arrow keys

keybind = cmd+up=text:\x1b[1;6P
keybind = cmd+down=text:\x1b[1;6Q

# Close pane

# Zoom/maximize pane toggle
